connectTimeout.display=Connect timeout
connectTimeout.help=Timeout for LDAP server connection (in milliseconds)

maximumNumberOfAttempts.display=Maximum number of attempts
maximumNumberOfAttempts.help=Maximum number of attempts to retrieve the entry or to re-try the operation. This number is applicable in replicated topology when handling connection failures and re-trying on another server, when following referrals and in similar situations.

baseContext.display=Base context
baseContext.help=The base DN used when no explicit base DN is specified

servers.display=Servers
servers.help=Structured definition of a server in the directory topology. It contains attribute-value pairs that define each individual server. The names of configuration properties can be used, separated by equal signs and semicolons, such as this: baseContext=dc=sub,dc=example,dc=com; host=sub.example.com; port=389  The server will be selected for each operation according to the baseContext that is specified in server definition. The most specific DN match will be used. If there are more multiple servers specified for the same baseContext then one of them will be selected randomly. The server which does not specify any baseContext is considered to be the default and that server will be used if the DN cannot be matched. This is equivalent to the server which is specified by ordinary configuration properties.  The configuration properties that are not explicitly specified in the server configuration line are taken from the ordinary configuration.

referralStrategy.display=Referral stratery
referralStrategy.help=Strategy of referral resolution. Values: "follow", "ignore", "throw"

passwordAttribute.display=Password attribute
passwordAttribute.help=Name of the LDAP attribute that is used to store account password

passwordHashAlgorithm.display=Password hash algorithm
passwordHashAlgorithm.help=Hash the passwords with a specified algorithm before they are sent to the server.

pagingStrategy.display=Paging strategy
pagingStrategy.help=Strategy used to send search requests that require paging. Usually specified preference over mechanisms such as VLV or simple paged results. Values: "none", "auto", "spr", "vlv"

pagingBlockSize.display=Paging block size
pagingBlockSize.help=Number of entries in one paging block. Used as a default value when page size is not explicitly specified in the request.

vlvSortAttribute.display=VLV sort attribute
vlvSortAttribute.help=Name of LDAP attribute used to sort the results if VLV is used for paging and no explicit sorting attribute is specified in the request.

vlvSortOrderingRule.display=VLV ordering rule
vlvSortOrderingRule.help=LDAP ordering rule to use in VLV requests. Some LDAP servers require explicit specification of ordering rule.

uidAttribute.display=Primary identifier attribute
uidAttribute.help=Name of LDAP attribute to use as a primary identifier. This will be used as ConnId __UID__ attribute. The default is entryUUID which is the best choice for modern LDAP servers. Value of "dn" can be used here to use entry DN as a primary identifier.

operationalAttributes.display=Operational attributes
operationalAttributes.help=Names of significant LDAP operational attributes. Connector will try to return these attributes in each entry.

readSchema.display=Read schema
readSchema.help=If set to true (which is the default) then the connector will try to read LDAP schema.

schemaQuirksMode.display=Schema quirks mode
schemaQuirksMode.help=Some LDAP servers use strange or non-standard variations of schema definition. The quirks mode is used to tolerate these variations and use as much of the schema definition as possible.

allowUnknownAttributes.display=Allow unknown attributes
allowUnknownAttributes.help=Accept also attributes that are not defined in schema. Single-value string is assumed as the attribute type.

usePermissiveModify.display=Use permissive modify
usePermissiveModify.help=Use permissive modify LDAP control for modify operations. Possible values: "never", "auto", "always". Default value: auto

synchronizationStrategy.display=Synchronization strategy
synchronizationStrategy.help=Strategy to use for almost-real-time sycnrhonization. Values: "none", "auto", "sunChangeLog", "modifyTimestamp"

baseContextsToSynchronize.display=Base contexts to synchronize
baseContextsToSynchronize.help=List of base contexts DNs that will be accepted during synchronization. If set to empty then all DNs will be accepted.
